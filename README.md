## Description
This application allows the user to play a basic tic-tac-toe game against a friend.  
To win the game you need to be the first person to get 3 of your icons in a row.
Here are some step by step directions for people who have never played before:
1. Choose who wants to be "X" and who wants to be "O"  
2. Have player "X" choose a tile and mark it with "X"  
3. Switch players  
4. Have player "O" choose a tile and mark it with "O"  
**Note, once a tile is marked with either "X" or "O", it can not be changed**  
5. Switch players
6. Do steps 2-5 again until there is a winner or there are no more tiles left to pick.  
7. If the board has 3 tiles in a row be the same icon, that player is the winner.  
7.5 If the board has no tiles left and no winner, then the game is a draw.  

This application is not for online multiplayer nor does it have an AI for singleplayer.
